# 🩺 Medicine Scanner with OCR + OpenFDA API 🔍💊

A mini yet impactful healthcare utility built using **Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR**, designed to identify medicine strips or packets in real-time using a webcam and provide instant usage information.

This project demonstrates how AI + Computer Vision can power **medicine identification**, especially useful for:
- Health apps
- Digital prescriptions
- Elderly assistance
- Rural/low-tech areas where drug info access is limited

## 🔧 Features

- 📷 **Real-time Webcam Scanner** using OpenCV
- 🔍 **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** via Tesseract to extract medicine names
- 🧠 **Local dictionary** lookup for known medicines
- 🌐 **API fallback to OpenFDA** for live drug data (usage, warnings, etc.)
- 🗣️ **Text-to-speech (TTS)** voice assistant that speaks medicine purpose
- 🔗 **Browser redirection** to trusted websites like Drugs.com
